# Auth Sample App

Base application for the workshop [Authorization for Social Networks in Rails](https://codigofacilito.com/talleres/rails-autorizacion) in CÃ³digo Facilito.

In this workshop we will learn to make the feature of private accounts that we see in Social Networks that we use daily.
For this we will learn about authorization with Pundit and we will apply advanced methods of Active Record to be able to integrate multiple associations between models.
We will go from the idea to the execution of a complex feature.
